bonus 1)
I have a textual record of the player's plays in terminal. It
follows the format specified in part 1 of this project

bonus 2)
I display all card in the player's hand and grey out the cards
that are valid. I provided textual prompt indicating if the player
has valid moves or only has discards

bonus 3)
A player may join into the game on another player's turn by taking over
a computer's position. This is sort of like the opposite of RageQuit which
is also implemented

bonus 4)
I used the fork/execve paradigm to use canberra-gtk-play to play a folder of
.ogg files along with the game. The folder must be placed in the same 
directory as straights. To enable this feature, the compile statement must
have -DMUSIC. I orginally wanted to use gstreammer or gstreammermm, but 
the school server is missing both the -dev program for these two libraries.
I tried to install them myself, but I didn't have permission.
